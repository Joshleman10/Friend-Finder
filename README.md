# Friend-Finder

Currently working towards completion of this project.  The only remaining portions include the following:

1: Getting the array from Friends.js on the first click of the submit click event.
2: Running this updated array through algorithm in APIroutes.js to compare the person submitting the survey to another friend in the server's
storage
3: After the comparison is made, display the friend most alike the user that submitted the survey

This application is still a work in progress.
